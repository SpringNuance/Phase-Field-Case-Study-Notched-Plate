 AVERAGE HEAT FLUX                   0.00       TIME AVG. HEAT FLUX   1.000E-02
 ALL HEAT FLUX RESIDUALS ARE ZERO
 ALL TEMP.    INCREMENTS ARE ZERO
 ALL CORRECTION TO TEMP.    ARE ZERO
          THERE IS ZERO HEAT FLUX EVERYWHERE

 ITERATION SUMMARY FOR THE INCREMENT:   2 TOTAL ITERATIONS, OF WHICH
   0 ARE SEVERE DISCONTINUITY ITERATIONS AND  2 ARE EQUILIBRIUM ITERATIONS.
